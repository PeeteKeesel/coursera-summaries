    "- **Interpretable Machine Learning**: defined as developing machine learning models that are inherently understandable and self-explanatory.\n",
    "- **Occam's Razor**: If you have two competing ideas to explain the same phenomenon, you should prefer the simpler one.\n",
    "- Linear models are highly interpretable as their predictions are based on a weighted sum of input features.\n",
    "  - The coefficients directly indicate the importance and directionality of each feature.\n",
    "- Enforcing sparsity, for example, via lasso or elastic net regularization, can enhance interpretability by driving coefficients of irrelevant features to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "- Generalized models try to solve some of the problems with linear regression. For example, generalized additive models combine linear models with nonlinear feature transformations, while maintaining an additive and interpretable structure, showing how each feature shape impacts predictions.\n",
    "- Regression and generalized models give us interpretable coefficients. \n",
    "- The sign positive or negative of a coefficient indicates whether the associated feature has a positive or negative relationship with the variable. \n",
    "- The magnitude of a coefficient represents the strength of that relationship. \n",
    "- Larger coefficients indicate a stronger influence of that feature on the target variable.\n",
    "- Decision trees like CART and GOSDT are also intrinsically interpretable models. Their hierarchical tree structure of if-then-else decision rules provides a natural way to trace how predictions are made for different instances based on their feature values. Rule-based models encode knowledge in the form of human-readable rules.\n",
    "- Tree-based models split the data multiple times based on certain cutoff values in the features. Different subsets of the data set are created through this splitting with each instance belonging to one subset. The terminal, also known as leaf nodes, are the final subsets. To predict the outcome in each leaf node, the average outcome of the training data in this node is used. \n",

    "There are explainable machine-learning approaches for nearly all models and domains. \n",
    "- **Local explanation methods** like LIME and SHAP focus on explaining individual predictions. \n",
    "   - They approximate the original model's behavior locally around the instance of interest using an interpretable model like linear regression. \n",
    "- In contrast to local explanations, **global explanations** aim to capture overall model behavior. \n",
    "  - Methods like functional decomposition, feature interaction, and partial dependence plots are considered global explanations. \n",
    "- **Example based explanations** operate by providing representative examples to support a model's prediction. \n",
    "  - Key methods include finding the most influential training instances that significantly sway a particular prediction if removed.\n",
    "- **NN Explanations**: Neural networks have their own challenges regarding explainability and thus approaches tailored for specific neural networks. \n",

    "#### Local Explanations \n",
    "##### LIME - Local interpretable model agnostic explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "- use interpretable models to explain individual predictions of a black box machine learning model.\n",
    "- Using LIME for images is really interesting. Image variations are created by segmenting the image into superpixels or interconnected pixels with similar colors, and turning them on or off by replacing each pixel with a user-defined color like gray. The user is also able to specify a probability for turning off a superpixel at each permutation.\n",

    "> ot of similarities to the lime approach. Again, we are explaining individual predictions, but this time, instead of using a linear model to approximate the local decision boundary as with LIME, we are now finding a decision rule that sufficiently anchors the prediction.\n",

The intercept, what the prediction is when all feature effects are set to zero. \n",

    "\n",
    "> When we consider decomposition, we first decompose a model prediction into a constant term, a term for each feature, and a term for the interaction between factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use the H-statistic for feature interaction. A partial dependence plot, PDP or PD, shows the marginal effect one or two features have on the predicted outcome of a model. \n",
    "- If this looks familiar, it should. It is the average of the lines of an ICE plot. Just like with ICE plots, the PDP can show the relationship between a feature and the target. PDPs do not have clear interpretations when features are correlated. In real life, features are usually correlated, or relationships between features are not well understood. \n",
    "- This is why accumulated local effects, or ALE, plots were introduced in 2020.\n",
    "  - ALE plots include local effects and accumulation. ALE plots focus on local changes in the prediction when a feature value changes, unlike PDPs, which average out the effects over the entire feature space.\n",
    "  - Instead of plotting the local effects directly, ALE plots accumulate these effects across the range of a feature. This helps in understanding the global trend of how the feature influences predictions.\n",
