# Machine Learning Specialization

This repository contains summaries for `Stanford`'s & `deeplearning.ai`'s _Machine Learning Specialization_ on Coursera. 

The Specialization is split into three courses:

1. [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://github.com/PeeteKeesel/coursera-summaries/blob/main/specializations/machine_learning_specialization/course1__supervised_machine_learning_regression_and_classification)
2. [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/PeeteKeesel/coursera-summaries/blob/main/specializations/machine_learning_specialization/course2__advanced_learning_algorithms)
3. [Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/PeeteKeesel/coursera-summaries/blob/main/specializations/machine_learning_specialization/course3__unsupervised_learning_recommenders_reinforcement_learning)
