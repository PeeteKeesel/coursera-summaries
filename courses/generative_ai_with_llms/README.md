# Generative AI with Large Language Models (LLMs)

This folder contains notebooks, summaries and notes for the course [Generative AI with LLMs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms) accesible on Coursera. The notebooks are all notebooks of the course. The solutions are my own work. All the rest has been created by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) in collaboration with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and thus, the credit goes to

## Notes 

Instead of downloading from S3 one can also directly copy the S3 content from a AWS SageMaker terminal. 

```bash
aws s3 cp --recursive s3://dlai-generative-ai/labs/w1-549876/ ./
```
